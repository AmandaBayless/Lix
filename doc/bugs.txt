General

    Linux and Mac issues
        Use Allegro 4.2 to compile it under Linux if things seem choppy with
        Allgero 4.4. Mac users can try to compile the game from source, or
        take a look at Phil's Mac port of the game, although that is currently
        out of date.



Menu

    --



Editor

    Multiple selection and copying
        Selecting multiple parts (with [Ctrl] or the set hotkey) and then
        copying everything does not guarantee correct z-order of the newly
        copied parts.

    [Shift]
        Don't hold shift, start dragging a frame with the mouse. While doing
        that, press and release shift. The selection will be cancelled in some
        way. It shouldn't happen, since shift shall only trigger the frame-
        -dragging when on too much terrain.



Gameplay physics

    Doors too tall
        Lixes won't enter some exits. Also, some exits aren't sized at
        multiples of 16 in both dimensions.

    Exploder flinging
        I tested it in Lix. What happens is actually the opposite of what you
        said should happen:
        -   If the second one bombs, it flings the first straight up
        -   If the first one bombs, it flings the second one forward

        Also, test assignment priority for stacked lixes. Inconsistent results?



Gameplay non-physics

    RR buttons
        Their numbers aren't redrawn correctly everytime.

    Multiple Hatches screen start
        In multiplayer, if the player will have multiple hatches, the screen
        start coordinates aren't calculated properly if the best point is
        a torus-seam-using combination of the hatch coordinations.

    Buttons and hotkeys
        During intense networking action, when a player selects skills with
        the keyboard hotkeys, the buttons may flicker. To remedy this, select
        the on/off graphic effect of a button during the draw step instead of
        instantly.

    Small torus maps and zoom
        If a very small torus map is displayed (vertically smaller than one
        screen) and zoom is switched on, the game may crash. It works for
        horizontally small maps. Thus, don't use the zoom on small torus maps.

    Two sounds from one lix at same time
        Due to the implementation of the effect manager, the same lix may
        only issue one sound to be played per update. If you jump into a trap
        that kills the lix on the exact frame after the jumper assignment,
        the trap/burn/kill sound won't play.
        


Network game

    [Esc] pressed during game
        It runs on properly, but cursor still opens over lixes.
