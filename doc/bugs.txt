General

    Linux and Mac issues
        The game will compile, but maybe not run properly under these OSes.
        A workaround may be to run it with the -w switch to achieve windowed
        mode. I will probably port the game to Allegro 5, hoping to fix it.



Menu

    --



Editor

    [Ctrl] and copying
        Selecting multiple parts with [Ctrl] and then copying everything does
        not guarantee correct z-order of the newly copied parts.

    [Shift]
        Don't hold shift, start dragging a frame with the mouse. While doing
        that, press and release shift. The selection will be cancelled in some
        way. It shouldn't happen, since shift shall only trigger the frame-
        -dragging when on too much terrain.



Gameplay physics

    Doors too tall
        Lixes won't enter some exits. Also, some exits aren't sized at
        multiples of 16 in both dimensions.

    Exploder flinging
        I tested it in Lix. What happens is actually the opposite of what you
        said should happen:
        -   If the second one bombs, it flings the first straight up
        -   If the first one bombs, it flings the second one forward

        Also, test assignment priority for stacked lixes. Inconsistent results?


Gameplay non-physics

    RR buttons
        Their numbers aren't redrawn correctly everytime.

    Multiple Hatches screen start
        In multiplayer, if the player will have multiple hatches, the screen
        start coordinates aren't calculated properly if the best point is
        a torus-seam-using combination of the hatch coordinations.

    Buttons and hotkeys
        During intense networking action, when a player selects skills with
        the keyboard hotkeys, the buttons may flicker. To remedy this, select
        the on/off graphic effect of a button during the draw step instead of
        instantly.




Network game

    [Esc] pressed during game
        It runs on properly, but cursor still opens over lixes.
