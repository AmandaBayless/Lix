If you've downloaded a binary package from the Lix website, read the first
chapter of this file.

If you've obtained the Lix source and wish to build the game yourself, read
the remaining chapters.



USING THE BINARY PACKAGE
------------------------

If you've downloaded a binary release from the Lix website, run the game
like this:

    ./bin/lix

You might get an error about a missing library, liballeg.so. In this case,
install the Allegro 4.2 or 4.4 runtime libraries. You can probably do so via
your favorite package manager.

I had problems getting the sound to work when linking Allegro statically into
the executable, so I fell back to dynamic linking for now.

The rest of this document describes how to build the game from source. If you
can run the game from the binary package, skip the rest.



NECESSARY LIBRARIES TO BUILD THE GAME
-------------------------------------

Lix uses these libraries:

    Allegro 4.2 (or 4.4) - graphics/game routines library
    enet 1.3.x           - networking library using UDP

You want developer libs for these. Allegro 4.x should be easily installable
via your favorite package manager. Alternatively, get its source from this
site, but make sure you get version 4.2 or 4.4; do not get 5.0.x:

    http://www.allegro.cc/files/?v=4.4

enet can be obtained from this site:

    http://enet.bespin.org

Read their documentation about how to install them. If you get stuck, feel
free to ask me for help, I've gone through the install process several times.
See readme.txt about how to contact me.

By default, the libs will be built dynamically. If you prefer static linking,
use this command line for Allegro 4 instead of the normal cmake invocation:

    cmake -DSHARED=0 -DSTATIC=1 <directory>

If you want enet to be built statically, use these ./configure options:

    ./configure --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no

If you have root access to your machine, you can install the libraries on
your system via make install. If you put them somewhere else, you will have
to edit the Lix makefile later.



BUILDING LIX
------------

If you did not install the libraries to /usr/somewhere, you have to tweak the
Lix makefile. In this case, alter the definition of the variable CXXFLAGS to:

    CXXFLAGS := -s -O2 -I/path/to/allegroincludes -I/path/to/enetincludes

Furthermore, alter the lines containing the linker arguments:

    LDDIRS   := -L/usr/local/lib -L/path/to/alleglibs -L/path/to/enetlibs

Finally, whether or not you had to change the makefile, invoke make from the
Lix root dir. It should build two binaries, ./bin/lix and ./bin/lixd. The first
binary is the game executable, it should be run from the game's root directory
or from ./bin/.

I didn't intend the game to be installed further in any way. All files reside
in a single directory somewhere under the user's home directory. Uninstall
the game by deleting that directory. Fitting the game into the regular unix
filesystem hierarchy standard is a long-term goal, this would allow
distribution e.g. via Linux package managers.

lixd is a standalone server daemon, it doesn't depend on any working directory.
Run it without command line arguments to get invocation info.

If you get problems, feel free to contact me. :-) See readme.txt for details.
