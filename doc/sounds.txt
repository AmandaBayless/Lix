assign.wav
    Status: done
    Event:  Clicking a lix to assign her the currently selected skill.
    Flavor: short, conforming, ding-like, okay-like

award_1.wav
    Status: missing
    Event:  Winning a multiplayer game alone, i.e. without tying.
    Flavor: A cool, elaborate fanfare.
    
award_2.wav
    Status: missing
    Event:  Sharing a multiplayer win with at least one, but not all others,
            or coming in second with enough players.
    Flavor: A fanfare, but a bit less elaborate than award_1.wav
    
award_3.wav
    Status: missing
    Event:  Finishing with neither a highest nor a lowest score.
    Flavor: Maybe an even less elaborate fanfare, or basically anything that
            doesn't sound especially good or bad.

award_4.wav
    Status: missing
    Event:  Finishing with a lowest score.
    Flavor: funny, signalling failure, shouldn't be a fanfare

brick.wav
    Status: done
    Event:  Builder has placed a brick and it was one of her 3 last ones.
    Flavor: very short, "tock" or "bob"

clock.wav
    Status: done
    Event:  Each second if the remaining level time is 15 seconds or less.
    Flavor: very short, mechanical like a clock hand, different from brick.wav

fire.wav
    Status: done
    Event:  Death from catching fire.
    Flavor: around 1 second of length, anything that sounds somewhat like fire

goal_bad.wav
    Status: done
    Event:  An own lix enters the goal/exit of an opponent.
    Flavor: voice, annoying, immediately alerting, maybe sad
    
goal.wav
    Status: done
    Event:  Any lix, no matter her color, enters the player's own goal/exit.
    Flavor: May be voice, or just any satisfying, spammable sound. The very
            first moments should be among the loudest of the whole sound,
            because the sound will be aborted and replayed everytime a new lix
            enters the goal. This may happen each update if they are clustered,
            and the game runs at 15 physics updates per second.

hatch.wav
    Status: done
    Event:  Hatches/entrances open at the beginning of the level.
    Flavor: anything moving/opening/mechanical

jumper.wav
    Status: missing, to be done by me
    Event:  Assigning the jumper skill. It's an exception to assign.wav.
    Flavor: a short "hop" shout, similar to how it was done in Lemmings 2.

lets_go.wav
    Status: missing, to be made by me most likely
    Event:  Before the hatches open, but after the level has started.
    Flavor: Euphoric slogan/shout

oblivion.wav
    Status: missing
    Event:  Death from falling/walking out of a non-wrapping map.
    Flavor: Anything, preferably short

ohno.wav
    Status: missing
    Event:  A player nukes, or an L1-style exploder is about to explode.
    Flavor: I suppose I should split this into two sound files, one for the
            exploder and one for the nuke. No special ideas about the flavor
            of either one.

ouch.wav
    Status: missing, to be made by me
    Event:  A lix lands on her belly after tumbling.
    Flavor: voice, a short voiced shout, the beginning should be one of the
            loudest parts of the file for the same reasons as goal.wav.

overtime.wav
    Status: done, can of course be redone if someone is good at this
    Event:  Overtime triggers in a multiplayer game.
    Flavor: "Ding!", a markant, fun bell sound, like a boxing bell.

panel.wav
    Status: done
    Event:  Player selects a different skill from the panel at the bottom
    Flavor: A short, confirming, mechanical sound.

pop.wav
    Status: missing
    Event:  Exploder explodes
    Flavor: Very short and markant.

roperhit.wav
    Status: missing
    Event:  unused, I haven't yet added the roper skill, unsure if I ever
            will -- but in that case, this'll be used for when the hook hits
            the terrain and gets stuck there. Don't spend time on this...
    Flavor: short, metallic

roper.wav
    Status: missing
    Event:  unused, see roperhit.wav, this might be used for shooting the rope
            in the first place. Again, don't spend time on this.
    Flavor: unsure

splat.wav
    Status: missing
    Event:  A lix splats from falling too high.
    Flavor: A saturated splatting sound. It may or may not be voice acting,
            in case of the latter, I should probably do it, but anything else
            is also very fine here.
    
steel.wav
    Status: done
    Event:  Ground remover hits steel and stops working
    Flavor: Very metallic

water.wav
    Status: done
    Event:  A lix enters water and will die from drowning
    Flavor: like dropping some object into water. It must be immediately
            recognizable that this has something to do with water.

yippie.wav
    Status: missing
    Event:  Player has saved enough lixes in singleplayer
    Flavor: anything conforming, doesn't have to be voice acting
