\_____________________________________________________________________________/



Menu

    Scroll bar for lists
        Maybe?

    Navigation with cursor keys and return
        This might be useful for the big level browsers.

    Replays in the single player menu
        Levels with available replays should be marked differently in the
        single player menu, and maybe replays should be started directly
        from there.



Editor

    Automatic terrain generation
        Make just one copy of the terrain and have the game copy it next to
        itself multiple times according to the number of players

    Rotate/mirror group
        If multiple elements are selected, rotating/mirroring should act on
        the objects' relative positions as well. The idea is to rotate/mirror
        a large part of the terrain to create symmectic levels more easily.



Gameplay

    Show lixes in/out of hatch
        At the moment, you can only see the total of in-hatch and out lixes.
        One should be able to see the number of lixes in the hatch as well.

    Display hotkeys
        Display the skill hotkeys on top of the OSD buttons.

    Out of Skill
        Make a special sound when you're trying to switch to a skill you're
        out of (via hotkey or clicking on it)

    Roper
        Implement the roper skill from L2.

    Resolution
        Higher resolution than the internal 640 x 480 inside the game, even
        if it won't be used in the menu.

    Nuke disabling
        Each level could have the nuke for multiplayer disabled. Players
        can still activate a nuke-like function then, but it merely takes
        away control over their tribe and starts the overtime.
        
    End of the time limit
        When the remaining time has reached zero, currently lixes are still
        able to enter the exit as long as the nuke's exploder assignment
        was late on them. This allows level solve times over the maximum.
        Maybe lems should explode immedeately instead of exiting when walking
        into an exit with the clock being zero?

    Auto-save replays
        Maybe?



Network

    Observer mode
        People shall be able to watch a game, i.e. to pick an option besides
        the colors. Even better would be if a newcomer could view the ongoing
        game.

    Statistics
        After a game, you can view better statistics than now. The better
        screen could show how many lems every player got from whom.

    Save levels locally
        Either automatically save any played networking levels locally,
        or give an option to do it per level.

    Level info in the lobby
        Show the level details (author, title, initial skills, ...) somewhere
        in the lobby, maybe as a tooltip.



Single Player

    Highscores
        Allow to save more than one high score per level.
