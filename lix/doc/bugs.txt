Legende

    (!)
        Heavy bug, I should remove this immediately.

    (?)
        People claimed this, but I haven't been able to reproduce it yet.

    (/)
        I did something to remedy this bug, but I don't know whether the
        bug is fully resolved.



Generell

    Linux and Mac issues
        The game will compile, but maybe not run properly under these OSes.
        A workaround may be to run it with the -w switch to achieve windowed
        mode. I will probably port the game to Allegro 5, hoping to fix it.



Menu

    Option help text
        In the sound tab of the options menu, the *) text for the "load sound
        driver" option is wrong. It should read "requires a program restart".



Editor

    [Ctrl] and copying
        Selecting multiple parts with [Ctrl] and then copying everything does
        not guarantee correct z-order of the newly copied parts.

    [Shift]
        Don't hold shift, start dragging a frame with the mouse. While doing
        that, press and release shift. The selection will be cancelled in some
        way. It shouldn't happen, since shift shall only trigger the frame-
        -dragging when on too much terrain.

    Steel dialogue (?)
        phil said that it doesn't close on pressing cancel, instead it closes
        and opens again right away.
        


Gameplay

    RR buttons
        Their numbers aren't redrawn correctly everytime.

    Multiple Hatches screen start
        In multiplayer, if the player will have multiple hatches, the screen
        start coordinates aren't calculated properly if the best point is
        a torus-seam-using combination of the hatch coordinations.

    Buttons and hotkeys
        During intense networking action, when a player selects skills with
        the keyboard hotkeys, the buttons may flicker. To remedy this, select
        the on/off graphic effect of a button during the draw step instead of
        instantly.

    One-way arrows
        Don't work yet. I don't know whether I will ever implement them.



Network game

    ESC menu
        The cursor opens when it's above lixes, even when the menu is in front.
        I don't know whether the lixes are also assignable.
