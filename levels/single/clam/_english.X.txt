Welcome to Clam's levelset for Lix!
This set contains 99 levels
across five ratings:

Flower: Beginner-level puzzles, with
identical stats and abundant skills.
Humane: Medium-hard puzzles, not
to be underestimated.
Arcane: Seriously tough puzzles, a real
test of your rodent-wrangling skills.
Insane: My toughest levels, designed
to challenge even the best players.
Flingsane: Levels that use the fling-
bomber ability in various ways.
